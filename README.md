What is it?

MIC offers minimal Python tools to check transactions, emission curve, ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs and others in order to prove that there is no inflation happening in Monero.

The tools here are just for educational purposes. They are no ready for production. They are the base for the project MIC - Monero Inflation Checker (temporarily hosted at criptando.pythonanywhere.com)
